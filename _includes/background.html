    <p>I'm a fifth year student at <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.ccis.northeastern.edu/" target="_blank">Northeastern University</a> in Boston expecting to graduate in May 2018. Thanks to Northeastern's co-op program, I've had the privilege of completing two wonderful six-month co-ops at <a class="underline-link" href="https://us.mullenlowe.com/" target="_blank">MullenLowe U.S.</a> and <a class="underline-link" href="https://starry.com/" target="_blank">Starry</a>. Currently, I'm spending my third and final co-op as a UI Engineer on the iTunes &amp; Apple Music team at <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/music/" target="_blank">Apple</a>.</p>

    <p>As a front-end engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge with my keen eye for design to help create a beautiful product. My goal is always to build products that are scalable and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.</p>

    <p><strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably snowboarding, cruising around on my penny board, or crossing off another item on my bucket list.</p>
